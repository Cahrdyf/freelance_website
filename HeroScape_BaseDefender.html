	    <h3>THE ANCIENT</h3>
		<br>
		<div>
		  <p>The ancient is a special 7-space tile that the enemy players must attack.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
		  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/i8Mg7mM.jpg" style="width:50vw; height:auto;">
		</div>
		<div>
		  <p>To completely destroy an ancient, an enemy was attack and destroy the numbered "outer"
		     tiles/nodes. (Any order)</p>
			 
		  <p>An enemy cannot destroy the "The Core" (The "X" tile) until all outer tiles/nodes are destroyed.</p>
		  
		  <p>
		    <b>Important information for setting up your ancient:</b>
		    <br>
			<ol>
			  <li>
			    Must be reachable by all sides; at least have one tile space bordering the ancient.
			  </li>
			  <li>
			    Ancients must be equidistant from each other; on opposite ends of the map. 
			  </li>
			  <li>
			    The path to each must to be reachable by heroes without flying ability, both back
				and forth. (No one way cliffs/pits, etc.)
			  </li>
			</ol>
		  </p>
		  
		  <div>
		    <p><b>ANCIENT STATS (Per Node/Tile)</b></p>
		    <ul>

			  <li>
			    Move: 0
			  </li>
			  <li>
			    Attack: 0 (<i>Cannot attack!</i>)

	    <h3>Glyphs</h3>
		<div>
		  <p>Glyphs are possessable items in this gamemode. You will permanently gain the bonuses
		  when one of your heroes picks it up, but only each player can only have ONE glyph at
		  a time. If a player wishes to pick up one they like better, their current one is either:<br> a.) destroyed
		  and discarded from play or <br>b.) Dropped in the place where they picked it up. 
		  <br><br>They keep the new glyph and take the new bonuses and lose the old ones. 
		  <br><br>
		  After taken, players can Glyphs can be dropped/abandoned on any tile; a player can also destroy glyphs 
		  for free/without combat if it is in their possession or they pick it up/land on it
		  to "deny" it for other players.	  
		  </p>
		</div>
		<h3>What does the Glyph of Brandar do?</h3>
		<img src="https://i.imgur.com/eLq1ojp.png" style="width: 20vw; height: auto;">
		<div>
		  <p>The <b>Glyph of Brandar</b> can only be obtained after slaying 
		    <a href="#champ" style="color: lime;">"The Champion" (click me to jump to section)</a>
			Upon death, the glyph is dropped where the champion once stood. (WARNING: A glyph is
			NOT picked up until a player's unit lands on it. Thus, they can be "stolen" from the
			slayer!
		  </p>
		  <p>
		    After landing on the glyph and deciding what to do with a previously owned glyph
			(if you had one), Roll the 20-sided die. <br>
			Do the following based on the result [for results higher than 10, minus 10. For example
			17 would be 7, 20 would be 10, 11 would be 1, etc.]:<br>
			
			<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/tL6v2Ho.png" style="width:50vw;">
			
			<br><br>1 = <b><span style="color: orange;">Immortality:</span></b> The gods give you 
			        another chance. 
					Bring back one dead hero, 
					giving them full health and refreshing abilities. 
					If you choose to pick a squad, bring
			        all of them back. For squads with survivors, 
					bring all units back and remove all damage
			        from all units. (Cannot be used if all members are alive.)
					
					<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/iZmoJIr.png" style="width:50vw;">
					
			<br><br>2 = <b><span style="color: lime;">Dragon's Bond:</span></b>
			        The gods offer you the restless soul of powerful dragon's ancestor. Give to a hero or a single
					member of a squad; keep the token underneath the chosen unit. That unit gains all of Mimring's abilities. When unit dies or is removed from play, discard
					Dragon's Bond from play. Inherits Mimring's movement speed if it is greater than
					the units base value. If the unit you chose was Mimring, nothing happens and 
					the glyph is destroyed. [MUST BE USED IMMEDIATELY. DESTROY OTHERWISE]
					
					<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/IYL0pvW.png" style="width:50vw;">
					
			<br><br>3 = <b><span style="color: aqua;">Wrath of Heaven:</span></b> The gods
			        smite your enemies. Use to deal up to 5 points of damage to any of the enemy player units on the map. Can be spread out to different players. 
					(Example: 2 to one of Player A's heroes and 3 to one of Player B's Hero). Cannot be dealt on heroes who are on their last hitpoint. Squad units may be killed by
					this effect. Discard after use.
					
					<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/zUBQtDO.png" style="width:50vw;">
	
			<br><br>4 = <b><span style="color: pink;">Vitality:</span></b> The gods heal you. 
			        Use to remove up to 5 hitpoints from any of your units.(Discard after use.)
					
					<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/rjpFdw4.png" style="width:50vw;">
					
			<br><br>5 = <b><span style="color: yellow;">Glimpse:</span></b> Strange energies surround the Champion's house. Re-roll!
			
			<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/HkOpK3r.png" style="width:50vw;">
			
			<br><br>6 = <b><span style="color: red;">Candy Bar:</span></b>
			        The gods do not respond, so you just loot the Champion's house.
					You find a candy bar underneath a piece of furniture. It looks very old but the
					packaging is still sealed!
					Use to heal 1 hitpoint from
					any of your units. (Discard after use.)
					
					<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/i6XgiBw.png" style="width:50vw;">
					
			<br><br>7 = <b><span style="color: lime;">Rune of Clairvoyance:</span></b>
			        The gods do not respond, so you just loot the Champion's house.
					You find an odd glowing crystal shaped like an eye.
					Use anytime during your turn to reveal all enemy players' order markers.
					Discard after use.
					
					<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/yNDijIh.png" style="width:50vw;">
					
			<br><br>8 = <b><span style="color: gold;">Diamond Splitter:</span></b>
			        The gods do not respond, so you just loot the Champion's house.
					You find an enchanted maul capable of tearing down castles.
					Give to one hero or unit and place it under them.
					For each <b>non-ranged</b> attack on an ancient, roll a 20-sided die.
					If you roll a 1 or 10 (or any number in between) you find a weak point
					and attack the core directly regardless of undamaged surrounding nodes.
					Roll defense dice for ancient like normal.
					
					<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/mcbDrtd.png" style="width:50vw;">
					
			<br><br>9 = <b><span style="background-color: white; color: Purple;">Masamune:</span></b>
			        The gods do not respond, so you just loot the Champion's house. You find
					a katana (japanese sword) possessed by the ghost of a legendary samurai. Give to one
					hero or unit and place it under them. They gain the "counter-strike"
					ability (See existing ability for samurai units.) Does nothing and is destroyed
				    immediately if given to a unit that already has this special.
					When possessing unit dies, discard the Masamune from play.
					
					<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/4kpsrE5.png" style="width:50vw;">
					
			<br><br>10 = <b><span style="color: Grey;">Rusty Sword:</span></b>
			        The gods do not respond, so you just loot the Champion's house. You find
					an old, plain longsword they probably kept for sentimental purposes. Give to one
					hero or unit and place it under them. They get +1 attack dice in non-ranged combat.
					When possessing unit dies, discard the Rusty Sword from play.

	    <h3>The Champion</h3>
		<img src="https://i.imgur.com/y1VhuMF.png" style="width:50vw;">
		<p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">
		  A warrior of great power 
		  and military prowess that's seen
		  many battles in their extraordinary life. The gods favor them and
		  rumors say they've
		  collected many rare artifacts in their numerous adventures.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		  <b>Choosing a champ</b>
		</p>
		<p>
		  Before choosing heroes and units for their army, the players must vote on a hero (no squads)
		  to be the Champ. Note that this hero will be not be available if chosen as the Champ. 
		  After potential champs are chosen, each player rolls the 20-sided die. Whoever rolls
		  the highest number has their selected hero become the champ for this game.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		  <b>Setting up the champ</b>
		</p>
		
		<p>
		  The champ is a formidable opponent.<br>
		  Apply the following to the champ:
		  <ol>
		    <li>+3 move for each participating player</li>
		    <li>+2 hitpoints for each participating player</li>
			<li>+1 attack dice for each participating player</li>
			<li>+1 defense dice for each participating player</li>
			<li>Pre-existing abilities are the same.</li>
			<li>Place Glyph of Brandar under champ's unit.</li>
		  </ol>
		</p>
		
		<p>
		  <b>Champ's Lair</b>
		</p>
		
		<p>
		  The champ starts off in their "lair". Place a 7-tile on the map
		  as equidistant as possible from all the players (the center of the map).
		</p>
		
		<p>
		  <b>The Champ's Behavior</b>
		</p>
		
		<p>
		  All order markers will alway be placed on the champ's card since it is a single unit.
		  They are <b>dormant</b> until someone attacks them. When attacked they become active and
		  will move toward and attack the unit that attacked them. (Mark the champs target with
		  a token.) They will keep attacking/pursuing that unit until they are slain or attacked by 
		  another unit. The new attacking unit gets targeted, so the target token moves to that unit.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		  The champ will take the shortest path possible to the attacking unit.
		  The <b>Glyph of Brandar</b> always follows the champ, kept below the unit.
		  When slain, the champ leaves the glyph behind; the next unit to land on the glyph 
		  (even if it's not the slayer's) may take the glyph or just destroy and deny it.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		  If the champ has destroyed their target, they will return back to their lair (taking the shortest path possible) and become dormant. Any unit that attacks them, however, will become 
		  the new target.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		  The champ always ignores and can't use <b>Glyphs</b>.
		</p>
		
		
		
		
	  </div>
	  
	  <div>
	    <h3>Ranged Attacks on an Ancient</h3>
		
		<p>
		  <b>Facing Walls</b>
		</p>
		
		<p>
		  Assume that the ancients are rather tall structures. Ranged units can only attack
		  the the tiles/nodes that are facing them. They cannot shoot through them to get at a node
		  in the back.
		</p>
		
		<img src="https://i.imgur.com/JjSOyOF.png" style="width:90vw; height:auto;">
		
		<p>
		  <b>Ranged Attack Resistance</b>
		</p>
		
		<p>
		  Nodes get +1 defense die against all ranged attacks. 
		  Cores get +2 defense dice against all ranged attacks.
		</p>
