	    <h3>THE ANCIENT</h3>
		<br>
		<div>
		  <p>The ancient is a special 7-space tile that the enemy players must attack.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
		  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/i8Mg7mM.jpg" style="width:50vw; height:auto;">
		</div>
		<div>
		  <p>To completely destroy an ancient, an enemy was attack and destroy the numbered "outer"
		     tiles/nodes. (Any order)</p>
			 
		  <p>An enemy cannot destroy the "The Core" (The "X" tile) until all outer tiles/nodes are destroyed.</p>
		  
		  <p>
		    <b>Important information for setting up your ancient:</b>
		    <br>
			<ol>
			  <li>
			    Must be reachable by all sides; at least have one tile space bordering the ancient.
			  </li>
			  <li>
			    Ancients must be equidistant from each other; on opposite ends of the map. 
			  </li>
			  <li>
			    The path to each must to be reachable by heroes without flying ability, both back
				and forth. (No one way cliffs/pits, etc.)
			  </li>
			</ol>
		  </p>
		  
		  <div>
		    <p><b>ANCIENT STATS (Per Node/Tile)</b></p>
		    <ul>
			  <li>
			    Hitpoints: 1/1 (<i>Since there are 7 nodes, think 7 total hitpoints.</i>)
			  </li>
			  <li>
			    Move: 0
			  </li>
			  <li>
			    Attack: 0 (<i>Cannot attack!</i>)

	    <h3>Glyphs</h3>
		<div>
		  <p>Glyphs are possessable items in this gamemode. You will permanently gain the bonuses
		  when one of your heroes picks it up, but only each player can only have ONE glyph at
		  a time. If a player wishes to pick up one they like better, their current one is either:<br> a.) destroyed
		  and discarded from play or <br>b.) Dropped in the place where they picked it up. 
		  <br><br>They keep the new glyph and take the new bonuses and lose the old ones. 
		  <br><br>
		  After taken, players can Glyphs can be dropped/abandoned on any tile; a player can also destroy glyphs 
		  for free/without combat if it is in their possession or they pick it up/land on it
		  to "deny" it for other players.	  
		  </p>
		</div>
		<h3>What does the Glyph of Brandar do?</h3>
		<img src="https://i.imgur.com/eLq1ojp.png" style="width: 20vw; height: auto;">
		<div>
		  <p>The <b>Glyph of Brandar</b> can only be obtained after slaying 
		    <a href="#champ" style="color: lime;">"The Champion" (click me to jump to section)</a>
			Upon death, the glyph is dropped where the champion once stood. (WARNING: A glyph is
			NOT picked up until a player's unit lands on it. Thus, they can be "stolen" from the
			slayer!
		  </p>
		  <p>
		    After landing on the glyph and deciding what to do with a previously owned glyph
			(if you had one), Roll the 20-sided die. <br>
			Do the following based on the result [for results higher than 10, minus 10. For example
			17 would be 7, 20 would be 10, 11 would be 1, etc.]:<br>
			<br>1 = <b><span style="color: orange;">Immortality:</span></b> The gods give you 
			        another chance. 
					Bring back one dead hero, 
					giving them full health and refreshing abilities. 
					If you choose to pick a squad, bring
			        all of them back. For squads with survivors, 
					bring all units back and remove all damage
			        from all units. (Cannot be used if all members are alive.)
					
			<br>2 = <b><span style="color: lime;">Dragon's Bond:</span></b>
			        The gods offer you the restless soul of powerful dragon's ancestor. Give to a hero or a single
					member of a squad; keep the token underneath the chosen unit. That unit gains all of Mimring's abilities. When unit dies or is removed from play, discard
					Dragon's Bond from play. Inherits Mimring's movement speed if it is greater than
					the units base value. If the unit you chose was Mimring, nothing happens and 
					the glyph is destroyed. [MUST BE USED IMMEDIATELY. DESTROY OTHERWISE]
					
			<br>3 = <b><span style="color: aqua;">Wrath of Heaven:</span></b> The gods
			        smite your enemies. Use to deal up to 5 points of damage to any of the enemy player units on the map. Can be spread out to different players. 
					(Example: 2 to one of Player A's heroes and 3 to one of Player B's Hero). Cannot be dealt on heroes who are on their last hitpoint. Squad units may be killed by
					this effect. Discard after use.
	
			<br>4 = <b><span style="color: pink;">Vitality:</span></b> The gods heal you. 
			        Use to remove up to 5 hitpoints from any of your units.(Discard after use.)
					
			<br>5 = <b><span style="color: yellow;">Glimpse:</span></b> The gods are enigmatic. Re-roll!
			
			<br>6 = <b><span style="color: red;">Candy Bar:</span></b>
			        The gods give you a delicious candy bar! Use to heal 1 hitpoint from
					any of your units. (Discard after use.)
					
			<br>7 = <b><span style="color: red;">Rune of Clairvoyance:</span></b>
			        The gods do not respond, so you just loot the Champion's house.
					You find an odd glowing crystal shaped like an eye.
					Use anytime during your turn to reveal all enemy players' order markers.
					Discard after use.
					
			<br>8 = <b><span style="color: red;">Diamond Splitter:</span></b>
			        The gods do not respond, so you just loot the Champion's house.
					You find an enchanted maul capable of tearing down castles.
					Give to one hero or unit and place it under them.
					For each attack on an ancient, roll a 20-sided die.
					If you roll a 1 or 10 (or any number in between) you find a weak point
					and attack the core directly regardless of undamaged surrounding nodes.
					Roll defense dice for ancient like normal.
					
			<br>9 = <b><span style="color: red;">Masamune:</span></b>
			        The gods do not respond, so you just loot the Champion's house. You find
					a katana (japanese sword) possessed by the ghost of a legendary samurai. Give to one
					hero or unit and place it under them. They gain the "counter-strike"
					ability (See existing ability for samurai units.) Does nothing and is destroyed
				    immediately if given to a unit that already has this special.
					When possessing unit dies, discard the Masamune from play.
					
			<br>10 = <b><span style="color: red;">Rusty Sword:</span></b>
			        The gods do not respond, so you just loot the Champion's house. You find
					an old, plain sword they kept for sentimental purposes. Give to one
					hero or unit and place it under them. They get +1 attack dice in combat.
					When possessing unit dies, discard the Rusty Sword from play.
